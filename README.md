# Hi there üëã
I started my career as a sound designer and after that I continued looking for a way to keep improving. So that's why, at the beginning, I have learned video editing. Later, to make animations, after that to 3D modeling, and finally, I have discovered that I was capable enough to apply programming to those jobs.

Since then, I have decided to have an impact on that, focusing mainly about programming, using my experience of the audiovisual world.

I'm focus on learn as much as I can from my teammates and from other areas too. That's the most value lesson that I've learned from my previous jobs. I'm good at teamwork, problem solving, and working to tight deadlines. I also believe in the importance of being organized and meticulous.

Nowadays I'm working to becoming a front end developer, mixing my two passions: design and development.

Curious, decisive and always ready to learn and help.

Also passionate about tech and sports üë®‚Äçüíªüèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è !
